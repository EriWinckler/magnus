08/09/2020: There's a bug going on depending on the size of the screen the webpage is being loaded, it does not render the skills bars with the right size to fit the screen, so I've implemented a bunch on changes on the SCSS to try to fix it.
    Solved the problem with some screen sizes but still not 100%.

08/16/2020: After I watched the Scrimba class on React I've learned how to properly add class based component, so used that new knowledge to add random color style to the skills bars.
